# Cordo

Cordo is a developer-experience-first Discord App and UI library for TypeScript.

Cordo is built for and used in production with over 700k discord servers at https://freestuffbot.xyz/.


## Concepts

Cordo is taking inspiration from modern web-frameworks with concepts like **File Based Routing**, **Composables**, and **Error Boundaries**.

Cordo is also completely stateless allowing for incredibly easy load balancing, super light ram usage, and more. (This doesn't mean your bot cannot have state. It very well can.)

Cordo also abstracts away a lot of constraints/burdens on Discord's interactions api like completely hiding and managing *custom_id*s and automatically laying out components into rows or labels.

Cordo can be run as a standalone web-server (recommended) or integrated into existing Discord api libraries like discord.js.


## Quick Start

That's to do lol.

If you wanna see how it looks like using cordo, check out the `./test` folder for some almost up to date demo project.
